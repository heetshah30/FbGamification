# To examine the impact of Gamification on Facebook Users

Social media has been a rage over the past couple of years, even though it is almost 20 years. On an average globally, internet users spend 126 minutes a day every day on social media. Of all the social media channels present in the world, Facebook is the largest social media website by number of active users. 

Our research is restricted to Facebook, which is the most popular social network worldwide. As of the third quarter of 2018, Facebook had 2.27 billion monthly active users. In the third quarter of 2012, the number of active Facebook users had surpassed one billion, making it the first social network ever to do so. Active users are those which have logged in to Facebook during the last 30 days. Furthermore, as of the previous quarter the social network had 1.74 billion mobile MAU. 

Of late, the past couple of years, people have been spending less and less time on Facebook while Facebook wants people to spend more. This has led Facebook to try out new features and new techniques to keep people engaged. One of the techniques is gamification, which is the use of game-type elements within a non-game environment. This technique has been used by a lot of companies in lot of different industries. 

So, our purpose of the research was to understand how Facebook employs gamification among its varied set of new features and how it can be effectively applied to a cluster of users on the website to efficiently apply those features. The reason we chose this topic is because although Facebook has been around for quite some time and Facebook users have different behavior to these different behaviors as has been shown in previous research, there is no research to link the new and upcoming gamified features to these users based on their behaviors. So, we wish to link these the users and the features for 2018 and contribute a data-backed strategy that explains the phenomena.
